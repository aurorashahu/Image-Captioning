# Image-Captioning
Image Captioning system using a combination of Convolutional Neural Networks and Long Short-Term Memory networks. MSCOCO 2014 dataset. The CNN is used to extract features from images (ResNet50 and InceptionV3), and the LSTM is used to generate captions based on those features. Model learns to describe the contents of an image in natural language.
